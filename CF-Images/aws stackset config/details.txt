Now, the second step we have to do

is to create the execution role.

So this CloudFormation templates must be applied

in all the target accounts that you want to use

the StackSet feature in.

Now we are in a single account type of setting,

so we have to deploy this template as well

in the same account.

But imagine that if you had different target accounts

in AWS, then you would deploy these template

in all the target accounts.

This is an initial setup that you cannot avoid

unless you are using AWS organizations.

So, this template has a parameter,

which is the administrator account ID

that we'll have to specify.

This is necessary to allow this role

to be trusting in assuming the parent role, admin role.

So this is going to create an IAM role,

and this is going to have the right name, and the idea's

that we're going to have an assume role policy document

to say who can assume this role,

and we'll have a reference to the administrator account ID,

so fairly easy.
